This repo is part of my growing portfolio of projects as I continue learning the ins and outs of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Virtual-Pet Replica In JavaScript

This project utilizes the Phaser.js library (framework) to replicate a mobile version of Virtual-Pet 2D game. 
Rather than building an HTML5 JavaScript game from scratch, Phaser.js framework helps with asset loading, canvas rendering, audio
inputs, physics and more. 

### Prerequisites
